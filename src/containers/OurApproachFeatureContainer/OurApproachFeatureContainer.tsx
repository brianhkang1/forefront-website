Now, retrieving clean water only takes a fraction of the time which means more time for school and work.

Its aim is to educate about the importance of hand washing and distributing soap to villages without easy access to soap.Community engagement is a unique facet of our organization that allows us to collaborate with and  understand and assess the individual needs of each community we serve. We facilitate programming that will ultimately be empowering to the local men, women and children to take ownership and initiative in their own communities. Community engagement bridges the sustainability of all our pillars.",
