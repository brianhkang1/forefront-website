        Our school is located in Kolluru, India, where children have no access
        to a high quality education. Of the 18,000 primary-aged children living
        within 5 miles of our school, just 60% attend. Secondary school
        attendance is 37% in Kolluru, 74% in India, and 76% worldwide. Just
        among the 2nd grade children attending school within 5 miles from
        Kolluru, 33% cannot recognize letters, 20% cannot recognize the numbers
        1 through 9, 80% have no computer access, and 44% have no toilet access.
        Here at our facility, we plan to change that.
